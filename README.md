WeatheRun was Arthur Roncey and Ian Boynton's was a exercice in Vanilla Javascript with AJAX calls. In a later iteration of the project, we converted the application into a REACT.JS application.

A demo is available at http://weatherun.herokuapp.com/

WeatheRun utilizes Accuweather’s location and indices API to provide runners with Accuweather’s 5-day running indices in a linguistic, aesthetically pleasing format.
